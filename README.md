# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Time Series Forecasting

This project is part of a Data Analytics Internship. It focuses on analyzing and forecasting stock market trends using various time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM. The goal is to develop models that can understand trends, detect seasonality, and make accurate future predictions based on historical data.

---

## ðŸš€ Objectives

- Understand time series concepts: trend, seasonality, noise, cyclic behavior, stationarity.
- Collect and preprocess historical stock market data.
- Apply forecasting models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM.
- Evaluate and compare model performance.
- Visualize results through plots and dashboards.
- Optional: Deploy models using Streamlit or Flask.

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Prophet, TensorFlow/Keras
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub
- **Deployment (optional)**: Streamlit or Flask
